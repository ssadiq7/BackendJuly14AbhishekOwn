public interface WinningStrategy {

// The design makes limited use of interfaces and no use of abstract classes.
// The WinningStrategy interface is a positive aspect, allowing for different winning conditions to be implemented.
// However, there are missed opportunities for abstraction and polymorphism.
// The design could benefit from interfaces for movement strategies, player behaviors, or board elements.
// The Dice and Move classes could be abstracted to allow for different implementations.
// Consider adding: abstract class BoardElement
